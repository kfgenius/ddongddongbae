// This is an abstract class which contains the basis for any game scene which is going
// to be used.  A game scene is a self contained class which is responsible for updating 
// the logic and rendering the screen for the current scene.  It is simply a way to 
// encapsulate a specific scenes code in a single class.
//
// The Director class controls which scene is the current scene and it is this scene which
// is updated and rendered during the game loop.

// This property allows for the scenes state to be altered
@property (nonatomic, assign) uint sceneState;

// This property allows for the scenes alpha to be changed.  Any image which is being rendered
// uses the Director to get the current scene and from this it will take the current scenes
// alpha and use this when calculating its own alpha.  This allows you to fade an entire scene
// just by changing the scenes alpha and not the individual alpha of each image
